# Card Notes

This file contains notes regarding the monumental task of adding all Goat Format legal cards to Goat Duels. These cards all have not been added to the game yet.

# Basic
The following cards were labeled "basic" but are not.
- Ancient Telescope: This will actually need quite a bit of scripting required to make this work.
- Arsenal Robber: Requires scripting, but should be pretty easy.
- Blue Medicine: Requires prepopLP
- D.D. Dynamite: This card has been added. However, we could prehaps consider more complicated prepopLP parameters to handle cases like these in the future.
- Dark Designator: This will require very complex scripting (or perhaps just let the opponent view their entire deck).
- Destruction Ring: Needs prepopLP
- Dian Keto the Cure Master: Needs prepopLP
- Fiend's Hand Mirror: It is possible that this card's PSCT may be incorrect, but this is not a big concern.
- Fruits of Kozaky's Studies: Requires scripting
- Gift of the Mystical Elf: See D.D. Dynamite notes.
- Goblin Thief: Requires prepopLP
