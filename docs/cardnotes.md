# Card Notes

This file contains notes regarding the monumental task of adding all Goat Format legal cards to Goat Duels. These cards all have not been added to the game yet.

# Basic
The following cards were labeled "basic" but are not.
- Ancient Telescope: We could just use a mill 5 script for this.
- D.D. Dynamite: This card has been added. However, we could prehaps consider more complicated prepopLP parameters to handle cases like these in the future (see ticket #225).
- Dark Designator: This will require very complex scripting (or perhaps just let villain view their entire deck).
- Fiend's Hand Mirror: It is possible that this card's PSCT may be incorrect, but this is not a big concern.
- Fruits of Kozaky's Studies: Requires scripting
- Gift of the Mystical Elf: See D.D. Dynamite notes.
- Graverobber: Already added, but its text not may be correct.
- Jade Insect Whistle: Added, but could use some resolution notes (see ticket #226)
- Ray of Hope: Requires shuffle script
- Reckless Greed: Requires draw skip script
- Reload: Requires shuffle script
- Restructer Revolution: See D.D. Dynamite notes
- Solar Ray: See D.D. Dynamite notes
- Spellbook Organization: Requires significant scripting
- The Inexperienced Spy: Added, but could use some resolution notes (see ticket #226)
- The Spell Absorbing Life: See D.D. Dynamite notes

# Easy
Notes regarding cards labeled "easy".
- Balloon Lizard: See D.D. Dynamite.
- Cobra Jar: Will require its own token and script.
- Convulsion of Nature: This shit is far from "easy." Will require voodoo-level scripting.

Note: Only cards from A-G have been evaluated so far.
