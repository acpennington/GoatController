      "story": "As of now, cards that require you to put cards on the bottom of your deck (e.g. Good Goblin Housekeeping) can now be used. In addition, the server correctly prints messages when you move cards from your hand to your deck. Before there was an issue with it revealing those cards to your opponent. This update also includes a minor bug in the way that certain script buttons were displaying. I hope you guys enjoy! Lots of progress is being made, and we're getting closer and closer to open beta with each passing day."

In the future, other people will be able to post their own content as well. This is all still a work in progress, but hopefully you get the basic idea.<br>Do you have any suggestions on how to improve this page? Just message me on discord. As a beta tester, your feedback and support always means a lot to me. Play some games with each other and let me know if you run into any issues. Remember, I can't improve Goat Duels without your input. Thanks again, everyone."
