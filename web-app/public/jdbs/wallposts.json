In the future, other people will be able to post their own content as well. This is all still a work in progress, but hopefully you get the basic idea.<br>Do you have any suggestions on how to improve this page? Just message me on discord. As a beta tester, your feedback and support always means a lot to me. Play some games with each other and let me know if you run into any issues. Remember, I can't improve Goat Duels without your input. Thanks again, everyone."
